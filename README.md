# 2018Summer_CUHKinternship

Here are some python codes I wrote during the 2018 summer internship, when I was working on image preprocessing for a audio-visual speech recognition research project at CUHK

The file video_dlib_latest.py is to use a open source package dlib to detect and cut off the mouth region in the speech video. 

The file autoencoder_latest.py is to use autoencoder to compress each mouth image data into a characteristic vector that has lower dimension but still keeps the feature of the image. The vector will be used in the following recognition process.
